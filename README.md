# Indicators
Throughout my many years of trading, I have developed quite a few indicators on various platforms using their custom programming environments. It always started with a problem: "How can I better visualise this?" closely followed by: "Why has no-one done this before?" I therefore had no choice but to dive in and learn the new language (Although I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it:)

## Pinescript
This however is one language I did not actually enjoy learning. Pinescript was built to be intuitive for the mostly retail level TradingView crowd. It had also undergone a few upgrades to its core language and therefore I found it anything but intuitive and when searching for examples online, you would more often than not, get results with obsolete Syntax. Using AI to help me with Pinescript also wasn't great due to the different versions of the language and so I found myself reluctantly learning Pinescript and building what I needed. I have to add, that I initially avoided migrating to Sierra Charts because a) SierraCharts' Customer Service is somewhat elitist (They are the best and they know it... They may well be but the attitude doesn't help I'd say), b) They never do promos or discounts and c) because of the learning curve. TradingView on the other hand was up and coming, they had huge promos and a free version to hook you in. TV looked nice and promised an easy learning curve. I am not one to shy away from learning (I could happily study all my life!) I just did not have the time and so I went for the easy and convenient alternative i.e. TradingView. Taking the easy route has generally been a bad choice as opposed to following my intuition but it still happens sometimes unfortunately. So I ended up spending more on platform fees because I needed a higher tier to create custom charts (pairs trading and spread calculation) and the effort and pain it took to get along with pinescript most likely outweighed any strain I would have felt, learning Sierra (especially since Sierra Script is C++, the same as SuperCollider which I heavily coded in during my Bachelours and Masters Degrees). In addition to being annoying, Pinescript also had many limitations (on top of TradingViews many limitations: no Tick charts and no auto trading). Back then you could not import data from an external source. This has since changed to five data imports per day (probably on some extra premium subscription only) and I'm not sure what the current status quo is. One main limitation was (and quite possibly still is) that you could only import data in string format and that each string was limited to some four thousand elements, which sounds like a lot but isn't a lot at all. I had these daily spreadsheets of darkpool, phantom- and block trades that I wanted to visualise on my TV charts because all of the providers simply used the TV widget which gave the worst possible resolution and very limited interactivity. I needed a much more granular approach but was stuck with the limit. The workaround? create a python script to clean and sort the code, create three final text files with pre-written Pinescript indicator code and insert the data into each file, broken up into blocks of string arrays to keep below the limits, then convert the comma separated numbers out of the strings into floating point numbers and aggregrate them into a new array. I did all that manually in Excel prior to having that python app and it would often crash OpenOffice halfway through the cleaning process. Here is a picture of the final indicator showing Darkpool, Phantom- and Blocktrades in different colours using the width of the chart as the total range for the percentage adjusted values (Creating the range from the largest value in each category). In addition you can also See Price sweeps/Gaps and Cascades of Highs and Lows visualised by other indicators I built:

### NinjaScript
Due to limitations of using Rithmic for PropTrading, I ended up migrating to NinjaTrader where I then had to learn NinjaScript (C#). I wanted to also get back into Strategy creation and backtesting (This used to be great in MetaTrader). In order to do so, and also to make use of Tick Data (TradingView still offered only 1 second data at its most granular back then; now Tick Data is finally available on TV through the highest subscription tier, but you can also get it for free with NinjaTrader... or any other platform for that matter), I ported some of my TV indicators to Ninjascript:

### MQL4
Just like every other Retail Trader back then, I started out with MetaTrader4 before eventually moving on to MetaTrader5. I learned to code in MQL4 and then MQL5. I backtested and programmed my way through every available indicator only to realise that none of them offer any edge over the markets. I ended up creating my own programmes helping me visualise and trade better. In MT4 I created a hotkey system to allow easier and faster entry and exit, monitoring the spread and automatically entering my trades below a maximum threashold to avoid slippage. It also helped me visualise risk per trade and profit potential with straight forward hotkey adjustments. I also created an extensive programme to help me log my trades, mood and market prep on a daily basis which would export all the data to CSV at the push of a button to further analyse my performance at the end of the trading day.

### MQL5
In MT5 I created an app to give me an overview of the entire market with every single price update. Again, I hit the limits of the platform when I got to 500 charts being open at the same time (you had to open the chart in order to receive the data) so I knew I had to migrate to another platform before long. This indicator included all the constituents from the Dax Index as well as Major Indices and FX Pairs and of course the top tickers from the S&P500 and Nasdaq (until I ran out of charts).
